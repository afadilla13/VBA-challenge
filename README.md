# VBA-challenge
This is my first ever coding challenge experience in VBA from Monash University!

This code loops through all the worksheets in the workbook containing 3 year of data!
It sumamrizes each different ticker symbol, calculate the yearly change from the opening price to closing price and calculate the percent change and the total volume for each ticker. 
And format to a different color depending on the value as it loops through.

It also finds the ticker and value in percentage relating to the greatest increase and decrease.

Shout out to mainly google, chatgpt and theodormoreland [in githu](https://github.com/theodoremoreland/YearlyStocks/blob/master/AnalyzeStockData.cls) who I referred to during the past week and made my own kind of VBA code for this challenge.
