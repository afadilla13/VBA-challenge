# VBA-challenge
This is my first ever coding challenge experience in VBA from Monash University!

This code loops through all the worksheets in the workbook containing 3 year of data!
It sumarrizes each different ticker symbol, calculate the yearly change from the opening price to closing price and calculate the percent change and the total volume for each ticker.

It also find the tickers relating to the greatest increase and decrease value in percentage.

Shout out to mainly google, chatgpt and theodormoreland https://github.com/theodoremoreland/YearlyStocks/tree/master who I referred to during the past week and made my own kind of code.
